/**
 * nostr_core.h - C bindings for Nostr client library
 * 
 * This library provides NIP-17 private direct messaging for libpurple plugins.
 * 
 * Thread Safety:
 *   - All functions must be called from the main thread (GLib main loop)
 *   - The client uses internal async operations but callbacks are delivered
 *     synchronously when nostr_client_process_events() is called
 * 
 * Memory Management:
 *   - All *_free() functions must be called to release resources
 *   - Strings returned by the library are owned by the caller and must be freed
 *     with nostr_string_free()
